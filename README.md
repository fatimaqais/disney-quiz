The aim of the project is to build a responsive website/game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The website is responsive on mobile phones, tablet and desktop.

## __Features__
### __Common Features__
These features are seen throughout the whole quiz game:

- __Header__
- This is present on every page and shows the name of the quiz game to the user. The header is in a cursive font so it is similar to the original Disney logo. The text is on blue background colour to increase visibility for the user.
